Praveen N,4,"Mi to Fitbit Alta to Fitbit Versa to Apple Series 3 to Series 7Pros:- The best watch going around in terms of features, support and display- The straps and cases of any 42mm or 44mm Apple Watch works for 45mm- All the features work as advertised with a few hiccups- Battery lasts for more than 24 hours with light/modern usage (Hopefully the battery won‚Äôt degrade)- Watch faces and compilations are nice- 3rd party apps and supportCons:- So series 7 watches in India don‚Äôt get fast char...READ MORE",Value-for-money

Prasanta  Choudhuru,5,"Just Applemazing. Smooth and fast Watch OS with zero lag and with tons and tons of apple features. Display is too good,its so crisp and clear and with 1000nits of brightness there is no problem in visibility in most sunny days. Connectivity is so fast and convenient specially in the cellular versions. Plus so many health and sports features which works so well without any problems.READ MORE",Best in the market!
Tinu Tennyson,5,The best smart watch in the world. Period. I have Samsung Galaxy Watch and this as well and I can say that Apple Watch is way better in terms of its smooth touchscreen and user interface. Battery Life is pretty decent. Lasts a whole day with moderate to heavy usage and 2 if light usage  Call quality is very good as well. All apps and sensors are optimized. 41mm looks good on people with petite wrists. The only downside I can think of is that Samsungs Classic Watch has thick rotating bezels wh...READ MORE,Just wow!
prateek rai,3,"Cut long story short-1-Your body already gives you the sign before illness, so if you do't ignore them, then you do't need this watch.2- this is not as accurate as medical equipments so no use medically.3- you can get many attractive and show stoppers watches below 20K so still you do't need this because design is not very good.4- and if you want phone call and notification then take a break, your phone is enough..5- but of course if you need a status symbol, a show off, then this is one...READ MORE",Does the job
Sudeep Jain,5,"Amazing, in one word , BUT , If you already own a Series 6, there is no point of upgrading at all. One more piece of advice, If you want to buy apple watch and don't have any extra bands, go for 41mm without thinking.Steel Variant is good for PRO users, who work-out hard, as its made of ceramic and is scratch proof, I've been using it since Series 4 and I switched from Aluminum to Steel just for the sake of scratches on Display.Also, if you are a casual user, just by a Space Gray 41mm B...READ MORE",Just wow!
